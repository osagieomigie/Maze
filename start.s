// This routine is used to establish an environment in which
// a C program can run. We create this environment only on
// CPU Core 0. The other cores simply run an infinite loop.
//
// The stack pointer register is initialized to point
// just below the text section of the program. It grows
// backwards (toward 0), so it uses memory addresses
// below that of the _start routine.
//
// We also zero out all bytes in the .bss section, and
// then branch to the main() routine. The main() routine
// should never return to this code (it should be in
// an infinite loop), but if it does, we then put the
// CPU Core 0 into an infinite loop.
